My major/program:
Psychology & Neuroscience PhD
2nd year

Why did I take this course:
To fulfill my final Independent Study credit and catch me up to speed on analyzing neural data through this course

What got me in neuroscience/psychology:
An existential obsession with how humans can have such complex thoughts and inner experiences out of a tiny gelatinous blob in our heads. And then I took some psycholody course in undergrad that sold me on wanting to do research :)

your career plans (or post-graduation plans, if you haven't figured out the career vision yet!)
The most terrifying thing to answer! The dream goal would be to work in either a neurosci lab or in industry where I can use my coding and experimental design skills. Still exploring my options, but I'm enjoying the journey of doing so :)
