My major/program:
Psychology & Neuroscience PhD
2nd year

Why did I take this course:
To fulfill my final Independent Study credit and catch me up to speed on analyzing neural data through this course

What got me in neuroscience/psychology:
An existential obsession with how humans can have such complex thoughts and inner experiences out of a tiny gelatinous blob in our heads

your career plans (or post-graduation plans, if you haven't figured out the career vision yet!)
The most terrifying thing to answer X3 - the dream goal is to be able to work in either a neuroscience or comp sci labratory where I can use my coding and experimental design skills.
